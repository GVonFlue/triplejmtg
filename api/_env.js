   _env.js — one place that knows how to find Supabase from the server.

   WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN A TWO-LINE FIX IN EACH FILE.

   PORTED FROM GVonFlue/proytech-crm, where one server file read these
   variables differently from the rest: _guard.js and _spend.js accepted either
   spelling of the key and fell back to VITE_SUPABASE_URL for the URL, while
   api/_google.js accepted neither.

   This install starts with that already fixed. _google.js here is left reading
   its own variables for now (it predates this file and works); the tests below
   are the thing that stops the next new file from drifting.

   That asymmetry is invisible at setup and expensive later. This install's own
   docs said SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY in four files, and that is the spelling
   _google.js does NOT accept — so following them gave you a working assistant,
   a working rate limiter, and a Google Calendar integration that silently could
   not read its own token. Nothing errors; it just does not work, later, for no
   visible reason. The sister install lost every guarded endpoint to the same
   shape from the other direction.

   Patching that one file would fix today's instance and leave the next file
   free to reintroduce it. So the knowledge lives here once, and
   tests/envoneplace.mjs in the sister install fails the build if any api/ file
   reads these variables directly again. Worth adding here too.

   BOTH SPELLINGS, BOTH DIMENSIONS, deliberately:

     SUPABASE_URL              the server-side name
     VITE_SUPABASE_URL         the browser's copy — same value, and every real
                               install already has it, so accepting it turns a
                               dead subsystem into a working one at no cost
     SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY      the older short spelling, still set on installs
     SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY the name Supabase itself uses, and the one the
                               docs now tell you to set

   THE KEY HAS NO VITE_ FALLBACK AND MUST NEVER GET ONE. A VITE_ variable is
   compiled into the browser bundle, and the service-role key bypasses RLS
   entirely. That asymmetry is the point, not an oversight: the URL is public,
   the key is not.
